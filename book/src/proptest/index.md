# The `proptest` crate

The `proptest` crate provides most of Proptest's functionality, including most
strategies and the testing framework itself.

This part of the book is dedicated to introductory material, such as tutorials,
and general usage suggestions. It does _not_ contain reference documentation;
for that, please see the [rustdoc
documentation](https://altsysrq.github.io/rustdoc/proptest/latest/proptest/).
